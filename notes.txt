------ Sepsis Prediction Model Comparison -----

In this study, multiple machine learning models were evaluated for early sepsis detection using ICU data. 
The models exhibited different predictive behaviors, highlighting the trade-off between sensitivity (recall)
and specificity (precision).

The XGBoost model achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.84 and a recall of 73%, indicating strong ability to identify 
sepsis patients. However, its precision was low (7%), meaning it produced many false alarms. This behavior
is suitable for an early warning system, where missing a critical patient is more dangerous than issuing 
extra alerts.

The Random Forest model showed the highest ROC-AUC (0.93) and PR-AUC (0.63), with extremely high precision 
(99%). This indicates that when the model predicts sepsis, it is almost always correct. However, its recall 
was low (18%), meaning many true sepsis cases were missed. Therefore, this model behaves like a confirmation 
system, providing high-confidence predictions rather than broad screening.
